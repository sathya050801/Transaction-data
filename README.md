# Transaction-data
Transaction Data Visualization using Tableau
This is the transaction data in Australian dollars and it shows the individual transaction amount for the year 2016-2017
The visualization includes First name of the customer or the user and their transaction amount and it's currency 
I loved working with data and the tool
I recommend to use Power BI and Tableau for data visulaization
